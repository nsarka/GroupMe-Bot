# GroupMe chat bot

Supports reading in commands and then posting messages to the group. Forked from the sample bot by GroupMe.
```
Create a file .env with these env variables:
BOT_ID="botid"
PORT=5000
BOT_PRINT_IDK=true # When a user types an unrecognized command, print something or ignore it (do nothing)
NODE_ENV=production # production mode prints a message each time the bot restarts
```
